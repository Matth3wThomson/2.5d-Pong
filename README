This project is the game I created for my Game Development module. The focus of the module was on engine development, rather than actual game code. The engine is a 2-5d engine using box2D for physics.

All work found herein is property of Matthew Thomson. You are permitted to download and change the code as you wish, but all credit belongs to the owner.

To fork this repo you will need the following libraries:

Box2D
Glew
sfml 2.1
soil

The libraries must be in the same directory as the repo in order to run correctly.
